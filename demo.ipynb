    "# Better Than Vibes\n",
    "#### By J. Seaward\n",
    "\n",
    "While training and fine-tuning models models in a shoestring budget, the question of whether or not we had enough data was a constant problem. Is the problem with the model architecture? the implementation? or do we need more/better data? When I asked how we knew such and such data was enough the answer typically boiled down to \"vibes.\" Let us see if we can do ***better than vibes.***\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal at the outset was to be able to evaluate a fine-tuning or training set without (re)training the model.\n",
    "Have not come up with a way to check the sufficiency of a fine-tunin set in the absence of a task *and* model, nor uncovered a unversal scaling law for model parameters and sufficient dataset size. What we have come up with at this point is a way of prioritizing training data at both the sample and set level allowing for automatic pruning of training sets, allowing for cheaper/fast training without loss of performance, as well as ranking of potential fine-tuning sets. These methods rely on the information content of data labels and some simple geometric considerations. In this work, we consider data features as defining a *dataspace* where the data features behave as a basis for a vactorspace in which the samples lie. The label for ever sample then provides some information about it, which we quantify and estimate. To make evaluation of the data model-independant, we construct a self-ignoring distance weighted k-nearest neighbor classifier (explained below), which is applicable well to any dataspace with a meaningful distance metric, or model whose outputs vary smoothly and slowly in data-space.\n",

    "\n",
    "Shannon information, $I$, is the measure of information a character in a message brings to a receiver. The information a character $a$ brings is written $$I(a) = -\\log(p_a),$$ where $p_a$ is the probability that the character $a$ will be received. This probability is conditioned on the previous characters in the message *and* prior knowledge about the type of message. For example, a \"u\" following a \"q\" when the message is in English carries almost no information, since \"u\" nearly always follows \"q\" (conversely, any other letter carries large amounts of information, narrowing down the rest of the possible characters to only a handful). On the other hand, if the message were encrypted in such a way that all characters were equally likely, \"u\" after \"q\" would carry just as much information as any other character, them all having equal probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning back to machine learning, we can think of each sample in a test set as a message, beginning with the data and ending with the label(s). A model, then, is a machine that guesses the label(s), conditioned on the data *and* what it has seen during training. What we want a model to do is learn the patterns that allow one to infer the next part of a message, given the first part. A language model trained on English text would have learned that \"u\" nearly allows follows \"q\", for instance. We can then think of each *label* in a data set as holding a certain amount of information, depending on what the model has already learned. From here, we can start asking questions about how much data is enough and which data sets will be more useful for training."

    "### Label information without any data\n",
    "Without looking at the data or deploying any kind of model, the labels necessarily hold a lot of information. All we have to go on to guess the label of any given data point is the frequency of the label's occurrence. The information in each label, $y_i=c_i$, is written $$I(y_i) = -\\log_2[p(y_i=c_i)]$$ where the probability of label $y_i$ being the correct class for the sample, $c_i$, can only be crudely estimated. Note that data of the sample, $x_i$, plays no role and the base of the logarithm makes the unit of information the bit. Call this information given only chance $I^*$, and consider the a prioiri information."

    "So, a d-knn can estimate how informative a label at a point is given the point's neighbors and thus estimate which labels are most important to keep in a training set and which ones an be discarded. However, a vanilla knn will always return $I(y_i|x_i) = 0$ for all $(x_i,y_i)$ in its training set. That is what \"self-drop\" adresses. We provide a custom weights function (`fns._src._dist_weight_ignore_self`) which assigns a weight of $0$ to neighbors with $d=0$ instead of letting them determine the outcome of the classifier. This lets us estimate the amount of infrmation a trainig set has about itself."

    "When chosing a training set, we want to chose one that is as informative as possible. Ideally, it is iformative about the *test* set, but if the training set represents the test set, we can use the self-information about the training set to prioritize the training data, as shown above. However, to compare training sets of different sizes, we need a metric that is insensitive to the size of the set. Rather than use entropy (the average infromation per label), we use the *information rate*, $$r(X,Y;\\mathrm{clf}) = \\frac{I^*(X,Y) - \\sum_iI(y_i|x_i;\\mathrm{clf})}{I^*(X,Y)} \\qquad \\text{for  } x_i \\in X, \\;y_y \\in Y.$$ If $I^*(X,Y)$ is the a priori information in the dataset $(X,Y)$, then the sum gives us the total information left in by the classifier, $\\mathrm{clf}$. Dividing by $I^*$ givess us the protion of the information the classifier has learned. This can be thought of in terms of the extraction rate of the model:"

    "## Fine-tuning set selection\n",
    "Using the information rate proves an effective way to prune training data without losing signifocant performance. Now we consider the case where you have a trained model you wish to fine-tune. To do this, you must have a test set which defines your task, but you may be using a foundational model whose training data you do not have access to. The data selection task is then to chose between different pieces of training data for fine-tuning. When considering a fine-tuning set, we add two cinsiderations: the problem of class imbalanced datasets and geometrical measures of similarity. \n",

    "#### Geometric similarity measures\n",
    "When fine-tuning a model, it is useful to have fine-tuning data the is different from the data the model was originally trained on and simmilar to the test data defining the task. In this package we estimate difference and similatiry using the *overflow* and *overlap* of the convex hulls of the datasets. We use convex hulls because they are computationaly tractable in high dimension in a way that precise volumetric integrations are not. Otherwise, we would be comparing information densities at different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overflow of set $X_1$ from $X_2$ is the volume of data in $X_1$ outside the hull of $X_2$, given by $$ OF(X_1,X_2) = V(\\mathrm{Conv}(X_1\\cup X_2)) -   V(\\mathrm{Conv}(X_2)),$$ where $\\mathrm{Conv}(\\cdot)$ gives the convex hull of a set of points and $V(\\cdot)$ gives the volume of a shape. Since overlap uses the covex hull this can be thrown off by outliers. Normalizing by $V(\\mathrm{Conv}(X_1))$ can help with this since it estimates the protion of $X_1$ outside of $X_2$ which may be more interpretable and will be less sensitive to a few outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The overlap of $X_1$ with $X_2$ is the volume of $\\mathrm{Conv}(X_1)$ inside of $\\mathrm{Conv}(X_2)$ and is simply $$OL(X_1,X_2) = V(\\mathrm{Conv}(X_1)) - OF(X_1,X_2).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions for these quantities are `btv.selection.estimate_overflow` and `btv.selection.estimate_overlap`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of dataset selection, a good fine-tuning set should have a large overlap with the test set (for obvious reasons) and a large overflow from the training data, indicating it is now to the model. Without access to the orginal training data, one can use the information given by the trained classifier; data in has seem before will have litte information for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The selection routine\n",
    "The function called bellow, `btv.selection.select_ft_sets` takes in ordered list of fine-tuning set and selects, scores, and ranks them on different metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "btv.selection.fuzzy_argrank` does anything for you. It allows a tolerance between scores to count as a tie and them passes those elements back in an unchanged block where the block is ranked by its average."
